The goal of promedr is to pre-process data from ProMED and HealthMap
and produce a clean incidence time series that can be used in
analysis downstream. 

ProMED/HealthMap data are made available as a CSV with the following
columns:

+ Location
+ Country
+ Region/City
+ Disease
+ Species
+ Feed Language
+ HM Alert ID
+ Headline
+ URL
+ Issue Date
+ Alert Tag
+ New SC
+ New SD
+ New CC
+ New CS
+ Cumulative SC
+ Cumulative SD
+ Cumulative CC
+ RO
+ Feed Name
+ Report Source - Primary
+ Secondary Report Source


Processing this data consists of the following steps:

+ Extract the total cumulative case count as a sum of desired case
  categories (Confirmed, Suspected, or both)
+ If there are any duplicate alerts for a given day, merge them
  according to pre-specified set of rules.
+ Any inconsistent data points at the end of the time series i.e.,
  those that make the cumulative case count non-increasing, are moved
  using Chebyshev's inequality.
+ Any points in the middle of the time series that cause the cumulative
  case count to be decreasing, are removed using pre-specified rules.
+ Finally, missing data are imputed.
